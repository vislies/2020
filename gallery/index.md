# VisLies 2020 Gallery

October 27, 2020

Thanks to the COVID-19 pandamic, we had to hold VisLies as virtual meeting this year.
Although we always enjoy meeting each other in person, we were still able to have a great VisLies session.
We had probably the largest group ever, with around 75 people consistently participating.
Attendees spanned the globe from Austrailia to the U.S. to Europe.

Unfortunately, due to a snafu, we don't have a record of everyone who presented this year, so our gallary is a bit incomplete.
If you remember presenting something, send us a note to <a href="mailto:vislies2020@vislies.org">vislies2020@vislies.org</a> so we can add your contribution.

## Early Panic

It is no suprise that visualization lies about COVID-19 were a common theme this year.
[Ken Moreland] started by presenting this early infographic about COVID-19 from [an article in the Sun] from late January.
At the time, the disease was mostly constrained to China, but was beginning to spread around the world.
This was definitely a bad sign, but this graphic makes it look like the pandemic had already taken hold around the world.
If you look at the numbers, you see that all countries have only 1 or 2 cases, but are labeled the same as China with hundreds of cases.

But by far the biggest what the heck about this graphic are the black labels.
The black label for China is about the number of deaths.
Butthe black label on the U.S. is just about potential infections.
The similarity of the label design suggests that they are tomeanthe same thing, but you cannot get more different than a person confirmed dead and a person who may or may not have gotten sick.
It is a cheap trick to make the spread seem much worse than it actually was (at the time).

[Ken][Ken Moreland] provided this "corrected" version of the graphic.
In this graphic, each case is represented by a dot.
This shows the proportional amount of infections (total, not per-capita) in different parts of the world.

One issue with a display like this is that for a country with a small number of infections (for example 1), it can be difficult to see or notice.
There is a big difference between 0 and 1 infections.
To makeit more clear in what countries infections have occured, an arrow is provided to highlight the country.
